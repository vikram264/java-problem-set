 * The 4 roles in dependency injection
 * If you want to use this technique, you need classes that fulfill four basic roles. These are:
 *
 * The service you want to use.
 * The client that uses the service.
 * An interface thatâ€™s used by the client and implemented by the service.
 * The injector which creates a service instance and injects it into the client.
